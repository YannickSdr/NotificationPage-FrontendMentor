## Overview
Hello There, this is my first small project i am sharing with a public repository. I am self-learning code & webdeveloppement with free platforms such as OpenClassRoom (french) and FreeCodeCamp for 2 months, learnt so far HTML/CSS/JS. This challenge comes from Frontendmentor.io.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

Since I learnt mostly theorical notions and concepts for two months, I am glad I was able to put most of it into practice. To be honest the javascript part wasn't that much of a challenge but still was a really nice experience. The hardest and longest part was the CSS design, not being something I have done much either.
